## Additional Information ðŸ”¥

This application is the same as the 
[Login App (Basic)](https://github.com/arzak21st/login-app-basic) 
application, 
except that it utilizes Spring for managing objects, implementing the concept of Dependency Injection, 
besides integrating Hibernate for database interaction, rather than using plain JDBC. </br>
