- ### Steps

  - Press the **Fork** button (top right the page) to make a copy of this project on your own GitHub account.
  - Open **Git Bash** and navigate to where you want your forked project to be cloned.
  - Clone the project with the following command:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-project-name.git
      ```
      > Replace `your-username` with the actual username of your GitHub account, and `your-forked-project-name` with the actual name of your forked project. </br>
  - Open **MySQL Command Line Client** and try to login

      ```
      source path/to/your-cloned-project-name/login-app-db.sql
      ```

  [spring-context.xml](https://github.com/arzak21st/login-app-spring-hibernate/blob/main/src/main/resources/spring-context.xml) 
  file:
      ```
      <property name="username" value="root"/> <!-- Change to your MySQL username -->
      <property name="password" value="pass"/> <!-- Change to your MySQL password -->
      ```

## Additional Information 🔥

This application is the same as the 
[Login App (Basic)](https://github.com/arzak21st/login-app-basic) 
application, 
except that it utilizes Spring for managing objects, implementing the concept of Dependency Injection, 
besides integrating Hibernate for database interaction, rather than using plain JDBC. </br>
